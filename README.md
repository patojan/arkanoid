# arkanoid
Project for learning Java.
It is an arkanoid style game, based on youtube video "Java Game Programming - Develop a Brick Breaker Game" by Awais Mirza.
My improvements of original version: changed size of gameplay screen, improved keyboard controls, controllable bounce direction, time limitation, customizable map layouts saved in files, campaign mode
